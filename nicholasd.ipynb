    "ThesisCoachGPT is a specialized AI mentor that helps PhD students structure, refine, and defend their dissertations with confidence. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, it’s fine-tuned on thousands of successful dissertation abstracts, defense transcripts, and academic feedback patterns across disciplines. The model understands how arguments are built, how committees challenge ideas, and how top researchers respond under pressure. Students can use it to generate outlines aligned with disciplinary conventions, simulate realistic Q&A sessions, and get targeted feedback on clarity, logic, and scholarly tone. ThesisCoachGPT acts as a round-the-clock academic coach, helping students move from scattered drafts to confident defense-ready presentations.\n"
