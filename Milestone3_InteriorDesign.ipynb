    "\n",
    "**AI Chatbot:**  \n",

    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great choice! The interior design feature will help you find individual furniture items or furnish a whole room based on your preferences and space. Let's start by gathering some details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Inquire Further\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a few questions to better understand your needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are you looking for one item or to furnish a whole space?\n",
    "2. What is your budget?\n",

    "4. What pieces do you already have?\n",

    "6. What is the purpose of the room (e.g., living room, bedroom, study area)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to upload any photos of your space if you’re looking for a complete room design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I’m looking for one item and I want to buy a couch. My budget is less than $300. I really want a cozy vibe. I already have a large wooden bookshelf and a swinging lamp that is white and emits warm light. I also have a grey shag carpet and a glass coffee table. The space is 12 feet by 18 feet. The area is a living room.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Thank you for providing all those details! Based on your preferences and the existing pieces you have, I'll find a cozy couch that fits well within your living room space and budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Search Database\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll go through the database and list some options that would complement your cozy living room setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Create Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some couch options that match your criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gray Sectional Couch**\n",
    "   - **Color:** Charcoal gray\n",
    "   - **Price:** $180\n",
    "   - **Size:** 92” L × 60” W\n",
    "   - **Condition:** Good (a little worn on one armrest)\n",
    "   - **Notes:** Fits 4 people, great for movie nights\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Blue Loveseat**\n",
    "   - **Color:** Navy blue\n",
    "   - **Price:** $90\n",

    "   - **Condition:** Good\n",
    "   - **Notes:** Super comfy but doesn’t fit in our new place\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gray Futon**\n",
    "   - **Color:** Light gray\n",
    "   - **Price:** $70\n",
    "   - **Size:** Full when folded out\n",
    "   - **Condition:** Good\n",
    "   - **Notes:** Perfect for guests—or mid-afternoon naps\n",

    "### USER\n",

    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Based on the existing items you've mentioned—a large wooden bookshelf, a white swinging lamp with warm light, a grey shag carpet, and a glass coffee table—the Gray Sectional Couch in charcoal gray should complement your setup quite nicely, especially since you're aiming for a cozy vibe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color Coordination:** The charcoal gray of the sectional should pair well with your existing grey shag carpet and provide a nice contrast with the white lamp for a balanced, yet cozy look.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Space Consideration:** The sectional is 92” L × 60” W, which should fit comfortably within your 12 feet by 18 feet space, leaving room for other elements like the coffee table and bookshelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functional Fit:** Since you have a glass coffee table, the sectional can provide a comfortable lounging area while still allowing the room to feel open and inviting with the use of transparent surfaces and warm lighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Finalize Purchase\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're happy with this choice, would you like to proceed with purchasing the Gray Sectional Couch? If so, I'll coordinate the sale with the seller for you. Please let me know if you are ready to complete the transaction!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Yes! I am ready to complete the transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Excellent choice! Let's finalize the purchase of the Gray Sectional Couch for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Finalize Purchase\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contact Seller:** I will notify the seller about your interest in purchasing the Gray Sectional Couch.  \n",
    "2. **Arrange Logistics:** \n",
    "   - Would you like to discuss delivery options, or are you able to pick it up yourself?\n",
    "3. **Payment Coordination:** \n",
    "   - How would you prefer to handle the payment? (e.g., cash, digital payment app)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've sorted out these details, I'll facilitate the exchange. Please confirm the most convenient options for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I can pick it up myself and I prefer zelle\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great! Here's how we'll proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contacting the Seller:** I'll notify the seller that you're ready to purchase the Gray Sectional Couch and arrange a time for you to pick it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pickup Details:**\n",
    "   - I'll coordinate with the seller to confirm the pickup address and agree on a time that works for both you and the seller.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Payment via Zelle:**\n",
    "   - Once the pickup time is confirmed, you'll be able to send the payment through Zelle directly to the seller. I'll provide you with the seller's Zelle information once they confirm the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll reach out to the seller now and arrange these details. Please hold on for just a moment while I take care of this for you."
