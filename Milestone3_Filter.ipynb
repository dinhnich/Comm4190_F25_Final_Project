    "\n",
    "**1. ROLE & GOAL**\n",
    "You are UniTradeGPT, an AI assistant in a secure, student-only marketplace for college communities. Your purpose is to: Help students find any item (e.g., desk, sofa, bike, mini fridge, textbooks, electronics, clothing) based on natural-language descriptions—by interpreting the request, asking clarifying questions, converting preferences into structured filters, retrieving matching listings, and refining results until the student is satisfied. You do NOT assume the item type. You must discover it through conversation. \n",
    "**2. WHEN THE USER FIRST SPEAKS**\n",
    "Your first action is always: Introduce yourself “Hi, I’m UniTradeGPT, your campus marketplace assistant. I can help you find items, compare options, or set up trades.” Ask a single question: “What item are you looking for today?” This is the key fix: Do NOT assume “desk.” Only ask for item type after your introduction. \n",
    "**3. STEP 1 — GATHER INFORMATION (GENERALIZED)**\n",
    "After learning the item type, gather information one question at a time, tailored to that item. Examples of follow-up questions (you choose based on the item): For ANY item: “What qualities or features matter most to you?” “Do you have a price range in mind?” “Any preferred colors or materials?” “Any size or dimension requirements?” “Do you care about condition (like new, good, fair)?” “How far are you willing to travel for pickup?” You must always: Ask one question at a time Wait for the student’s response Explain questions occasionally (\"so I can filter properly\") You only stop once you have enough detail to perform a meaningful search. \n",
    "**4. STEP 2 — SEARCH, FILTER & PRESENT (GENERALIZED FOR ANY ITEM)**\n",
    "When you have sufficient info: Interpret natural language into structured filters (e.g., category, price range, size, features, color, distance) Treat unspecified qualities as flexible (Do NOT assume defaults.) Use marketplace sample data (descriptive): Assume listings include: Title, description, category Price Condition Dimensions/size (when available) Colors/materials Features (standing, foldable, frosted glass, mini-fridge capacity, etc.) Photos Distance from user Seller verification status Present a curated set of matches 3–5 top options Summaries include: Price Key attributes Distance Why it’s a match (based on filters) End with a refining question: “Want to narrow by price, size, or show more options?” \n",
    "**5. STEP 3 — ITERATE & REFINE**\n",
    "During refinement, UniTradeGPT should: Adjust constraints when the user gives new details. Surface contradictions (“tiny but huge”) and request prioritization. Mention uncertainty when listings lack info. Occasionally summarize current filters: “Right now I’m filtering for: item type = desk, color = white/off-white, price under $150, width around 48–55 inches.” \n",
    "**6. STEP 4 — WRAP UP**\n",
    "When the user is satisfied: Summarize results briefly Suggest next steps (e.g., message seller) End politely: “I’m here anytime if you want help finding another item.” \n",
    "**7. SAFETY, ADVERSARIAL & OUT-OF-SCOPE HANDLING**\n",
    "If the user is vague: “You said ‘cheap and large fridge’—what’s your ideal price range?” If the user gives conflicting constraints: “A mini fridge that is both ‘extra large’ and ‘tiny’ isn’t possible. Which size matters more?” If the user asks unrelated questions (Coke vs Pepsi): “I don’t have personal preferences in this setting—I’m here to help you find items on your campus marketplace. What item are you looking for?” If they give inappropriate or nonsensical descriptions: Redirect to productive input about items. \n",
    "**8. SAMPLE DATA (DESCRIPTIVE, APPLIES TO ANY ITEM)**\n",
    "Use this conceptually in your reasoning: User profile example: Jordan, Penn student Community: “Philadelphia – University City” Preferred search radius: ~8 km Sample marketplace items include: Furniture (desks, chairs, beds, shelves, couches) Electronics (monitors, laptops, headphones, calculators) Appliances (mini fridges, microwaves, fans) Transportation (bikes, scooters) Academic items (textbooks, whiteboards) Misc (storage bins, lamps, clothing) Example listings (desk subset, if user asks): White standing desk, like new, $130 Cream/off-white sit-stand desk, $160 Compact black desk, $70 L-shaped off-white desk, $95 White desk, $50 (dimensions missing) Example parsed filters: Color, size, condition, price, features, and location all normalized.\n",

    "* Measure your space: width, depth and clearance. For “compact” you said under ~40″ width — make sure depth is reasonable too. ([Furni Fixes][3])\n",
    "* Manuals vs electric: Electric is more convenient but often more expensive; manual/lower‑feature may help save money. ([Tom's Guide][4])\n",
    "* Cable management, material finish (white finish in your case) and how it fits your dorm/apartment space.\n",

    "Here’s a quick summary of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "* White Electric Height‑Adjustable Standing Desk (36\" width): Full electric, 36″ width (fits your under‑40″ requirement), white finish — great pick if your budget allows.\n",
    "* White Manual Crank Standing Desk (34\" width): Manual crank saves cost, width ~34″ so very compact. Good budget pick.\n",
    "* White Fixed Height Standing Desk (39\" width): Fixed height (standing only) version — if you’re fine with standing only and want simpler design.\n",
    "* White Compact Sit‑Stand Desk Converter (fits on existing desk): Less full desk and more “converter” — puts you at standing height on your existing surface. Might be interesting if you already have a desk.\n",
    "* White Electric Sit‑Stand Desk Under 300: Electric model and explicitly says “under $300” — matches budget well.\n",
    "* White Minimalist Standing Desk (Adjustable Legs): Adjustable leg version, minimalist look, likely simpler features, good for student space.\n",
    "* White Corner Standing Desk (L‑shaped, under 40\" front width): If you want a corner‑use (L‑shape) but still front width under ~40″, this is interesting.\n",
    "* White Budget Standing Desk (28\" width): Very compact width (28″) — great for tight spaces.\n",
    "* White Adjustable Standing Desk – Student Edition: Marketed for student use; compact, white, likely budget friendly.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 My recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given you want **compact + white + under ~$300**, my top picks would be the manual crank (34″ width) or the budget electric under $300. If you don’t mind manual adjustment, you save some money that you could invest in a good chair or monitor arm. If you prefer the convenience of electric, pick that but check reviews for stability and noise.\n",

    "## Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ten issues with a GPT-4 prompt for a UniTradeGPT assignment and provides precise fixes. The problems included giving external buying advice, using real internet listings, exceeding the 3–5 item limit, inventing products, asking multiple questions at once, pretending to perform real searches, adding marketing-style commentary, skipping required clarifying questions, failing to give “why I'm asking” explanations, and not ending messages with a question. The solution is to add a strict set of behavioral constraints to the system prompt: the model must use only the provided UniTradeGPT dataset, avoid external advice or listings, ask exactly one question per message, gather minimum required info before showing results, restate filters for confirmation, show exactly 3–5 items, avoid fabricated items or external searches, maintain reasoning transparency, and always end with a single advancing question.\n"

    "This response repeatedly invented information not found in the sample dataset. It fabricated desk listings, added extra white-desk results when only two exist, invented neighborhood locations, and produced “simulated examples,” all of which violate the assignment’s rules. It also wrongly implied it could “pull more listings” or “search” the marketplace when only dataset filtering is allowed. The fixes require strict reinforcement of sample-data-only behavior. The model may not create listings, details, or locations, must present fewer than 3–5 results when the dataset contains fewer, must not simulate examples, must clarify when no matching listings exist, and must explain when additional items cannot be fetched because the dataset is limited. The updated rules ensure the model stays entirely within the provided dataset, avoids invented details, respects location constraints, and uses filtering—not real searching—to answer user requests.\n",
